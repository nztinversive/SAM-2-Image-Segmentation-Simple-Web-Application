SAM 2 Image Segmentation Application Guide

1. Project Structure:
   - Frontend: HTML, JavaScript
   - Backend: Python with Flask
   - Environment: .env file for API token

2. Frontend (HTML):
   - Create a simple HTML structure with:
     - File input for image upload
     - "Segment Image" button
     - Result display area
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling

3. Frontend (JavaScript):
   - Implement image upload functionality
   - Send segmentation request to backend
   - Poll for segmentation results
   - Display segmentation masks when ready

4. Backend (Python with Flask):
   - Set up Flask application with CORS support
   - Create routes:
     - Serve static files
     - Handle segmentation requests
     - Check segmentation status
   - Integrate with Replicate API:
     - Send segmentation requests
     - Retrieve segmentation results

5. Environment Setup:
   - Store Replicate API token in .env file

6. API Integration:
   - Use Replicate's SAM 2 model for image segmentation
   - Handle API responses and format output for frontend

7. Error Handling:
   - Implement error checking and display in both frontend and backend

8. Testing and Debugging:
   - Test image upload, segmentation process, and result display
   - Use logging in backend for debugging

Key Points:
- Frontend sends image data to backend
- Backend communicates with Replicate API
- Application polls for results due to asynchronous processing
- Results include combined and individual segmentation masks

To recreate:
1. Set up project structure
2. Implement frontend with basic UI and JavaScript functions
3. Create Flask backend with necessary routes
4. Integrate Replicate API in backend
5. Implement result polling and display in frontend
6. Add error handling and logging
7. Test thoroughly and debug as needed
